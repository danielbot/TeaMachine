Currently, teamachine only knows how to do two things:

 1) run interpreter cycle benchmarks:

        ./shardmap <nopcount> <iterations>

    Where nopcount is the number of nops to execute inside a simple iterative
    loop, from zero to nine. For example:

        time ./shardmap 9 10000000000

   will do ten billion iterations of executing 9 interpreter nops, plus the
   loop overhead. The time in seconds will therefore be approximately the
   number of nanoseconds per iterpreter cycle. (Nine nops plus the loop
   iteration is a total of ten interpreter cycles.)


 2) if number of command line arguments is zero, then run a simplified
    read-eval-print loop. Type bye to exit. More details to follow on this.
